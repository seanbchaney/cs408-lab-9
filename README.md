## Overview
This project is an interactive **bouncing ball simulation** with an **evil circle** that the player can control to "eat" the bouncing balls. The game features:

- Object-oriented design with **Shape, Ball, and EvilCircle** classes.
- Collision detection and movement physics.
- A score counter that tracks the number of remaining balls.
- Smooth player-controlled movement for the EvilCircle.
